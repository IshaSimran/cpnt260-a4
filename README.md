The main goal of this site was to create a website for a client who is running an independent fitness program/business, and needs to be able to easily book new clients and interact with them. This website is an extention of the previous assignment with changes made.

Primary change made to site has been done by removing the image gallery, and replacing it with a hero section.The hero section contains the formpspree used, and the googlemaps integration is just above the footer and below the hero section.

I want to clearly state the main issue I had during this assignment was achieving a responsive hero image. It does stretch but I am working on my responsive skills. I wasn't able to get it to appear on mobile screens at first but I finally managed to achieve it by adding a margin to the hero content. However, I was not able to figure out how to have the option of having it removed for mobile screens.
