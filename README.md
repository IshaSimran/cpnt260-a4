The main goal of this site was to create a website for a client who is running an independent fitness program/business, and needs to be able to easily book new clients and interact with them. This website is an extention of the previous assignment with changes made.

Primary change made to site has been done by removing the image gallery, and replacing it with a hero section.The hero section contains the formpspree used, and the googlemaps integration is just above the footer and below the hero section.
